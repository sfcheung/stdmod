# stdmod: Standardized Moderation Effect and Its Confidence Interval

Functions for computing a standardized moderation effect in moderated
regression and forming its confidence interval by nonparametric
bootstrapping as proposed in Cheung, Cheung, Lau, Hui, and Vong (2022)
[doi:10.1037/hea0001188](https://doi.org/10.1037/hea0001188) . Also
